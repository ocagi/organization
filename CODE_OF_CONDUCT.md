# Code of Conduct (DRAFT)

**Status:** Draft for Community Input

This is a **working draft** of the OC-AGI Code of Conduct. We invite all community members to review, discuss, and help shape this document. Nothing here is final â€” this is the beginning of a collective conversation about the kind of community we want to build.

## Purpose

The Open Collective AGI community is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone who shares our mission of building AGI as a public good.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior and the consequences for unacceptable conduct.

## Our Values

We are building a community based on:
- **Respect** for all people, perspectives, and backgrounds
- **Transparency** in communication and decision-making
- **Inclusivity** that welcomes diverse voices and experiences
- **Good faith** engagement focused on collective progress
- **Human dignity** as a non-negotiable principle

## Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

### Be Respectful
- Treat others with dignity and consideration
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully
- Acknowledge when you don't know something

### Be Inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them feel included
- Use inclusive language
- Be mindful of cultural and linguistic differences
- Create space for voices that are often marginalized

### Be Constructive
- Focus on ideas and solutions, not personal attacks
- Disagree without being disagreeable
- Assume good intentions unless proven otherwise
- Contribute to discussions in ways that move the collective forward

### Be Transparent
- Be honest about your motivations and affiliations
- Acknowledge conflicts of interest
- Share credit appropriately
- Admit mistakes and learn from them

### Be Responsible
- Take ownership of your words and actions
- Consider the impact of your contributions
- Follow through on commitments
- Help maintain a safe and welcoming environment

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable in our community:

### Harassment and Abuse
- Threats of violence or violent language
- Personal attacks or insults
- Discriminatory jokes or language
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Posting private information without consent (doxxing)
- Intimidation or stalking

### Disruptive Conduct  
- Trolling or deliberately inflammatory comments
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Spreading misinformation in bad faith
- Spam or excessive self-promotion

### Violations of Trust
- Plagiarism or taking credit for others' work
- Misrepresenting affiliations or credentials
- Deliberately undermining the collective's mission
- Using the community for personal gain at the expense of others

### Discrimination
- Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other protected characteristic

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All OC-AGI repositories and GitHub spaces
- GitHub Discussions and Issues
- Future community platforms (Discord, forums, etc.)
- Any space where you represent OC-AGI
- Events and gatherings (virtual or in-person)

## Enforcement

### If You Experience or Witness Unacceptable Behavior

**During Inception Phase:**
- Report via GitHub Issue (with "Code of Conduct" label)
- Contact repository maintainers directly
- Document the incident with as much detail as possible

**What Happens Next:**
- Reports will be reviewed promptly
- Confidentiality will be maintained when possible
- Appropriate action will be taken based on severity

### Possible Consequences

Depending on the severity and frequency of violations:

1. **Warning:** Private communication explaining the violation
2. **Temporary Ban:** Temporary removal from community spaces
3. **Permanent Ban:** Permanent removal from all community spaces
4. **Public Statement:** In cases of severe or repeated violations

### Appeal Process

*(To be developed as governance structures are established)*

## Questions for Community Input

As this is a **draft**, we specifically need input on:

1. **Enforcement:** Who should handle reports? How do we ensure fairness?
2. **Appeals:** What should the appeal process look like?
3. **Mediation:** Should we have a mediation step before enforcement?
4. **Transparency:** How much should be public vs. private in enforcement?
5. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Are we missing important cultural considerations?
6. **Edge Cases:** What scenarios need clearer guidance?

## How to Contribute to This Draft

We want your input! You can:
- Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) about specific sections
- Submit an [Issue](../../issues) with suggested changes
- Share examples from other communities that work well
- Identify gaps or ambiguities that need clarification

**This Code of Conduct should reflect our collective values, not just one person's perspective.**

## Acknowledgments

This draft draws inspiration from:
- The Contributor Covenant
- The Django Code of Conduct  
- The Rust Code of Conduct
- Various open-source community guidelines

We acknowledge the many communities who have thoughtfully developed conduct standards before us.

## Status: Living Document

Even after this moves from draft to active status, we expect it to evolve. A good Code of Conduct reflects the lived experience of the community it serves.

**Let's build a community that reflects the world we want AGI to serve.**
