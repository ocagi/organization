# AI Interaction Framework

This folder contains files for managing AI agent interactions.

## Structure

- `.ai/s/` - **Sessions**: Persistent AI interaction sessions and experiments
- `.ai/t/` - **Temporary**: Temporary or one-off AI interaction sessions

## Purpose

The `.ai` folder provides a standardized location for:
- Storing conversation history and persistent state across sessions
- Organizing AI agent collaboration workflows and handoffs between operators
- Separating experimental work from stable sessions

## Committing Files

Files here should be committed to:
- Share context, workflows, and collaboration patterns with team members and agents
- Document AI-assisted development processes
