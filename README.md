# Open Collective AGI (OC-AGI)

> Building transparent, inclusive, open-source AGI for the benefit of all humanity

## 🌍 Overview

**Open Collective AGI** is a global initiative to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is developed as a public good, not a private asset. We believe that the future of AGI must be shaped by a diverse collective of people, not solely by powerful corporations and states.

This repository contains the foundational documents that define our mission, values, and principles.

## 📜 Founding Documents

Our organization is built upon two core documents:

### 1. [Open Collective AGI Manifesto](open_collective_agi_manifesto.md)
Our vision for creating an open-source, decentralized AGI project governed by a global, diverse collective of verified humans. This document outlines:
- Why centralized AGI development poses risks
- Our mission for transparent, inclusive, non-profit AGI
- Key principles: global diversity, digital identity, transparent governance, and open collaboration

### 2. [AI Privacy and Data Awareness](ai_privacy.md)
A practical guide to understanding and protecting personal data in the age of AI. This document explores:
- The risks of unchecked data collection
- Real-world examples of data exploitation
- How AGI could amplify these risks
- Actionable steps for individuals to share data wisely

**We encourage everyone to read both documents to understand our foundation and approach.**

## 🎯 Our Vision

We envision a future where AGI is:
- **A public good** accessible to all, not controlled by a few
- **Transparent and open-source** in its development and operation
- **Inclusive and diverse** reflecting all cultures, languages, and backgrounds
- **Respectful of human dignity** with rights and ethics embedded from day one

AGI may be 10–20 years away, but without early action, open-source efforts will lag behind corporate development. We must lay the groundwork today to preserve digital democracy and ensure AGI serves humanity, not just shareholders.
