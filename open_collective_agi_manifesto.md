# Open Collective AGI Manifesto

## Vision
We envision a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) is developed not only by powerful corporations and states but also by a collective of people, for the benefit of all.

## The Problem
Current AGI development is dominated by well-funded entities. This centralization risks creating unequal access to power, wealth, and decision-making.

## Our Mission
To create an **open-source, decentralized AGI project**, governed by a global, diverse collective of verified humans. Our mission is to build a future where:
- AGI is a **public good**, not a private asset.
- Development is **transparent, inclusive**, and **non-profit**.
- Human dignity and rights are embedded in AGI from day one.

## Why Now?
AGI may be 10–20 years away. Open-source efforts could lag even further without early planning. We must act today to:
- Avoid future dependency on corporate AGI.
- Lay the groundwork for public and distributed AGI infrastructure.
- Preserve long-term digital democracy.

## Key Principles
- **Global diversity**: Inclusion of all cultures, languages, and backgrounds.
- **Digital identity**: Use of secure, verifiable human identities (e.g. blockchain-based) to ensure real contributors.
- **Transparent governance**: Clear, community-driven decision-making processes.
- **Open collaboration**: Open tools, datasets, and models shared across the world.

## A Call to Engineers, Activists, and Visionaries
Join us in building an **open collective AGI** — a global movement to ensure the benefits of AGI are shared, not hoarded. Every contribution matters.
